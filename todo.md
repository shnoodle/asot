* Add in the genre of each artist underneath the artist's name. Where there are multiple (F2F, B2B, F3F, B3B), include all, separated by a dash. Use the same style as we've used for `Hosted by Beatbox`.
* Make the web page an iOS web app, so it can be installed like an app.
* Try to add local push notifications to the web page, so I don't need to create a native ios app.
    * The notifications should ping 5mins before an artist that I have in my picks is about to start.
    * Use a unique sound.
